\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}


\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}

 Demonstrate that the Portal Aspect software has the ability to read from
and write to a WebDAV server in the LSP.\\
This test plan performs only a partial verification of the applicable
requirements, as this Level 3 milestone was understood to represent
demonstration of the ability to interface with a WebDAV service, not the
LSP-system-level test of the full role of the User File Workspace in the
LSP design, and also because several of the relevant requirements also
address the User Database Workspace, which is not yet
available.\\[2\baselineskip]Note that at the time of testing, only a
demonstration-level WebDAV service was available, not integrated with
the Notebook Aspect user file system.

\subsection{Overall Assessment}
\label{sect:overallassessment}

This test was first carried out, successfully, in November 2019. ~At
that time the test was not modeled in Jira. ~In May 2020, after the
creation of Jira artifacts representing it, the test was repeated and
the results are logged here.\\[2\baselineskip]The Portal application was
verified to be able to be used to save both images and tables to the
user file workspace, and to browse and visualize images and tables in
the workspace. In addition (beyond the scope of the milestone) the
ability to create and use directories in the workspace was observed, as
well as the ability to download workspace files through the client Web
browser.\\[2\baselineskip]The capability is sufficiently useful that on
the back end it is now appropriate for the WebDAV service to be attached
to persistent storage visible in the Notebook Aspect.

\subsection{Recommended Improvements}
\label{sect:recommendations}

A minor issue with consistency of the file-naming UI between different
Portal screens was observed (whether the extension corresponding to a
specified filetype is shown with the filename typed by the user) and
should be made uniform across the Firefly application
(DM-24849).\\[2\baselineskip]The Portal provides basic directory
browsing, file reading, file creation, and directory creation functions.
It does not provide file deletion, renaming, moving, or copying, nor
directory deletion, renaming, or moving. In the LSST design phase we had
not decided how to support these functions, partly because of some
reluctance at an early phase to commit to delegating this capability to
JupyterLab. At this point JL seems to have become pretty stable and has
a lot of takeup, so it may be time at this point to make this
commitment.

\section{Detailed Test Results}
\label{sect:detailedtestresults}

\subsection{Test Cycle LVV-C151 }

Open test cycle {\it \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testrun/LVV-C151}{DM-SUIT-8: Portal Integrated with Workspace}} in Jira.

Test Cycle name: DM-SUIT-8: Portal Integrated with Workspace\\
Status: Done

This test cycle contains a single test case which demonstrates several
of the Portal Aspect features of interaction with the User File
Workspace.

\subsubsection{Software Version/Baseline}
Not provided.

\subsubsection{Configuration}
Not provided.

\subsubsection{Test Cases in LVV-C151 Test Cycle}

\paragraph{ LVV-T1818 - DM-SUIT-8: Verify Portal integration with workspace (via WebDAV) }\mbox{}\\

Version \textbf{1}.
Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T1818}{\textit{ LVV-T1818 } }
test case in Jira.

This test case verifies that the Portal Aspect software is capable of
accessing a file-oriented workspace via the WebDAV
protocol.\\[2\baselineskip]In so doing, it partially verifies several
Portal Aspect requirements that relate to this capability -
``partially'' because some of these requirements depend on workspace
capabilities which were not present in the prototype WebDAV service
delivered by the DAX group, because some of the requirements also cover
the User Database Workspace (not relevant to this milestone, and not yet
available), and also because the milestone was not envisioned as an
exhaustive test covering edge cases:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  DMS-PRTL-REQ-0003 (LVV-9846, Portal access to workspace) is covered at
  ``demonstration'' level, with basic tests of saving image and tabular
  data to the workspace, and only for the User File Workspace ~(there is
  currently no User Database Workspace prototype available);
\item
  DMS-PRTL-REQ-0046 (LVV-9886, Visualization of workspace data) is
  covered at ``demonstration'' level for a couple of FITS image and
  table files, and only for the User File Workspace;
\item
  DMS-PRTL-REQ-0110 (LVV-9954, Tabular data download) is covered at
  ``demonstration'' level, only for catalog data (there was no image
  metadata in the LSP deployment at the time of test), and only for the
  User File Workspace;~
\item
  DMS-PRTL-REQ-0095 (LVV-9932, Saving Displayed Tabular Data) is covered
  at ``demonstration'' level for a simple subset operation in the table
  browser; and
\item
  DMS-PRTL-REQ-0111 (LVV-9951, Image data download) is covered at
  ``demonstration'' level, and only for download from an image display
  screen itself (as LSST-style image metadata services, e.g., ObsTAP,
  were not available in the LSP at the time of testing).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
A read/write WebDAV service, accessible to the user performing the test,
must be available and under the same authentication redirect coverage as
the Portal Aspect and the TAP service used for the test.

Execution status: {\bf Pass w/ Deviation }

Navigate to the TAP search screen, if necessary (in case the default
Portal screen was changed since this test was written), and ensure that
the LSST TAP service associated with the chosen LSP instance is
selected.

\medskip }

{\footnotesize
Perform a TAP search on the AllWISE source catalog around the equatorial
coordinates (2, 0) (degrees), with a 30 arcminute radius, using the
Portal UI to specify the query (select the ``Single Table'' radio
button). ~\\
To find the AllWISE source catalog, select the ``wise\_00'' schema from
the schema menu, and then the ``wise\_00.allwise\_p3as\_psd'' table from
the table menu. Use the column selector pane of the search screen to
select the ``ra, decl, source\_id, w1mpro, w2mpro, w3mpro, w4mpro''
columns for retrieval.\\
When the query completes, note the total number of rows in the table, as
displayed in the table header, and record it.

 & Test Data \\
 & \begin{minipage}[t]{15cm}{\footnotesize
Equatorial coordinates: (2, 0), cone radius 30 arcmin

\medskip }
\end{minipage} \\ \cdashline{2-2}

 & Expected Result \\
 & \begin{minipage}[t]{15cm}{\footnotesize
This query should return about 12,000 rows of data. ~It should be
displayed in a table, as an overlay on a context image, and as a
configurable 2D density plot.

\end{minipage} \\ \cdashline{2-2}

 & Actual Result \\
 & \begin{minipage}[t]{15cm}{\footnotesize
The UI was straightforward to use to choose (and create, if desired) a
destination folder and save the file, but it did not provide an
immediate positive indication of successful saving. ~Clicking the
``save'' button again, however, to bring up the save-to-workspace UI
again, did display the just-saved file name and its size and date (see
included image).\\[2\baselineskip]The LSP team should think about
whether a ``file xxx.yyy successfully saved'' dialog requiring an ``OK''
action, or a transient on-screen notification, would be desirable. (Such
work would need to be deferred until the restart of Portal
effort.)\\[2\baselineskip]It was observed that, upon revisiting the
save-to-workspace UI, the file name was a link to a simple URL which
could be used to download the saved file to the client browser.

In the table viewer UI, use the ``funnel'' icon in the table toolbar, if
necessary, to make the column-header filtering text boxes visible.
~Locate the ``w1mpro'' column (band W1 magnitude), enter the filter
expression ``\textless{}8'', and hit TAB or RETURN to apply the filter.

{\footnotesize
Navigate to the legacy IRSA image access screen, using the blue
``External Images'' button at the top of the
screen.\\[2\baselineskip]Note that this and the following step are being
done exclusively to load an image into the viewer, not itself to
demonstrate an LSP-Portal-specific capability; these steps simply bypass
the lack of a current image query service in the LSP.
